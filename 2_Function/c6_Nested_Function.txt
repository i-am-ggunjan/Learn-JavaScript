    The Function which is declared inside another function is called Nested Function.
Nested Function :-

    Outer function is Parent function and Inner function is child function.


    Inner function is local to the outer function, it means we cannot access inner function outside the outer function.
    To use(access) inner function outside the outer function -> it(outer function) should return the reference of inner function. With the help of inner function reference, we csn generate a call.

    Lexical scope :- 
        It is the ability of JS Engine to search for a variable on the outer scope when variable is not available in the local scope.

        When a function is nested, Lexical scope is available. So, we can access the member of Parent Function.

    Direction of Lexical Scope :-
        It will be Parent to child.

    Closure :-
        It is an object.
        It have state of parent. 
        Closure is achieved when there us one function inside another function.
        With the help of Closure, child can access the variable which is present inside te parent function.

        Closure help us to achieve Lexical scope or "Scope Chain".

        Closure preserve(store) the states of parent function even after the execution of parent function is completed.

        child function will have the reference of Closure.

        Every time, parent function is called -> new Closure is created.

        Closure is a function inside another function (parent function) anf has the access to the variable that are declared and defined inside the parent scope.

        Closure has access to variable in three scope:-
            When variable declared in their scope.
            When variable declared in a parent function scope.
            When variable declared in Global scope.

    Disadvantage of Closure :-
        High memory consumption.
