Functional Programming :-
    Functional Programming is a programming technique where we pass a function along with a value to another function.

    In this approach, we generate "Generic Function". Here function task is not predefined. It perform multiple task not only single task.

    The Function which accept another function as a parameter or return a function is known as "Higher Order Function".

    The Function which is passed to another function or the function which is returned by another function is known as "Callback Function".

        syntax :-
            function variable_Name(task, parameter1, parameter2){
                return task(parameter1,parameter2);
            }

            task is also a function called Callback Function.
