<!-- Object -->
         It is real world entity which have states and behaviour.
         It is a block of memory.
         In object, data is stored in key-value pair. key-value pair should be seperated by comma.


         <!--Behaviour of key & How numeric_value key get implement -->
         Key will be of string type. Any other key type will convert into string.
         If we gave numeric key, it will converted to string and also get sorted by js engine automatically.
         If we try to access member that is not available, we will get undefined.


         <!-- Way to create object -->
         1. by curly_braces.
         2. by new keyword and object constructor.


         <!-- How to access object -->
         To access object member ---> we have to use dot_operator or sqaure_bracket with double_quotes.
                    <!--Syntax  -->
                object_referenece.member  
                object_referenece["member"] 
                    Member ---> key_name


         <!-- How to insert or update the key-value pair -->
         With the help of object_referenece and dot_operator or object_referenece and sqaure_bracket with double_quotes, we can update the key-vakue pair. If it is not present, it will get inserted else value will be updated.


         <!--  -->
         Value associated with index --> Array
         Value associated with key --> Object
         

         <!-- In object, value can't be access directly by using 'for of' loop.
         In array, value is access directly by using 'for of' loop because of indexing in array. -->

Nested Object :- 
    Nested objects are the objects that are inside another object.
