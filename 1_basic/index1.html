    <!-- <h1>Hello World!!!!</h1> -->
    <pre>
    JavaScript :- 
        It is a Scripting and Programming language. 
        Developed by Brendon Eich in 1995.
        It is dynamically-typed language --> It means while creating variable, we don't need to specify what type of data we want to store.
        It is reference based language.
        We use JavaScript to add functinality.
    
    To run JavaScript, we need JRE --> 1. Browser 2. Node JS
        1. Browser - It is made up of JavaScript. Every browser ha JS Engine.
        2. Node Js - Node JS is an application made up of J8 Engine &  c++ Bundle (code) --> Node JS help in creating server.
    
    Due to rapid growth of JavaScript --> Need maintain & managed --> Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification --> ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer Association).
    
    JavaScript Runtime componet --> JS Engine, Web API, Event Loop, Callstack, Callback Queue , Microtask Queue
    
        1. JS Engine :- It is a software that convert JS code to machine understandable language. In JS Engine, we hjave JIT Compiler --> In JS Engine, interpreter and Compiler works simulataneously to optimise the code at same time {Work of JIT Compiler}.
    
        2. Web API :- It act as a medium fro communication between two application. It helps JS Engine to communicate with outside enviroment.
    
        3. Event Loop :- It is a Program. It task is to monitor Callback Queue &  Callstack.
    
        4. Callstack :- It is part of Js Runtime enviroment. It stores the reference of executing instruction. It uses stack data structure to store instruction.
    
        5. Callback Queue :- We have Asynchronus instruction waiting for their instruction.
    
        6. Microtask Queue :- We have Asynchronus instruction waiting for their instruction.
    
    
    Tokens :-
        It is the Smallest unit of Programming language.
    
        Type of tokens : -
            1. Keyword   2. Identifier     3. literal
    
    1. Keyword :- It is reserved word that has special meaning in JS.
    
    2. Identifier :- Identifier are the user-given name like variable name, class name, functiion name.
    
    3. literal :- literal are the value which are used in Program for processing. The different type of literal are in JavaScript are categorized based on their type.
    
        Based on the types :- 1. Primitive type literal   2. Non-Primitive type literal 
    
    3.1. Primitive type literal
        In this we can store only single type of literal in a memory block.
        It is immutable i.e. Will not change.
        
        we have 8 Primitive type literal : - Those are - Number, Bigint, Boolean, Undefined, NaN, Null, Symbol, String.
    
    3.2. Non-Primitive type literal
        In this we can store multiple type of literal in one memory block.
        It is mutable i.e. We can change.
    
    
    Number :-
    Bigint :-
    Boolean :-
    Undefined :-
    NaN :-
    Null :-
    Symbol :-
    String :-
    
    
    Type Coercion
        The process of converting one type of literal into another type of literal implicitly (automatically) by JS Engine or explicitly (forcefully) by user is called type coercion.
    
        We have two type of Type coercion :- 1. Implicit Type Coercion  2. Explicit Type Coercion
    
    1. Implicit type-coercion :- The process of converting one type of literal into another type of literal automatically by JS Engine is called Implicit type-coercion.
    
    2. Explicit type-coercion : - The process of converting one type of literal into another type of literal forcefully by user is called Implicit type-coercion.
    
    
    Operator
        Operator are the pre-defined symbol performing some Operation on operands (variable, literal).
    
    
    Flow Control Statement 
        It change or alter the flow of execution of Program.
    
        1. Decision Making Statement    2. Looping Statement    3. Jump Statement
    
    Math Functiion
        math.random, math.sqrt, math.cbrt, math.pow, math.PI, math.log, math.abs
    
    
    
    Function
        Block of memory or set of statements performing some special taks.
    
        Function allow us to use code again & again {Code reusibilty}.
    
        Function code will run when Function is called.
        Function is object.
    
    
    Way to create Function or type of Function :-
        1. Function declaration (also called a function definition, or function statement)
        2. Expression Function / Function as a expression
        3. Immediate Invoke Function
        4. Arrow Function
    
    How to call a Function? :-
        To call a Function we need function_reference and paranthesis.
    
            syntax : - function_reference (argument);
    
        It will generate function call and function code will execute.
    
    
    1. Function declaration statement :-
    
        consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            The name of the function (Variable_Name):- it store the reference of function object (or says store function_reference).
    
            A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
    
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* statement we want to use or execute */ }.
    
                syntax :- function Variable_Name(parameters){
                    // statement
                    return;
                }
    
        Parameter:- Parameter are the variable declared in the function definition. Parameter have local scope i.e. we can use parameter inside function only. 
        Parameter are used to accept the value that are passed at the time of function call.
    
        Argument:- Argument are the value that are passed in the function call statement. Argument can be anything i.e. it can be literal or expression which gives a result.
    
        Return Keyword:- It is a keyword used as control transfer statement. It will stop the execution of function and return the control to the caller along with the data.
    
    
    Note:- The variable declared inside a function cannot be exist outside that function.
    Note:- If the function is not returning anything, JS Engine implicitly reurn undefined.
    Note:- Function hoisting only works with function declarations â€” not with function expressions. 
    
    
    2. Expression Function / Function as a expression :-
    
        Here,  we pass the function as a value to a variable.
    
        With the help of this variable, we call that function.
    
        The function which is passed as a value to a variable is referred as First Class Function.
    
        Expression Function can't be hoisted i.e. we can not use that function before declaration.
    
        Expression Function is also called Anonymous Function because it does not have to have a name.
        
            syntax:-
               let speak =  function (){
    
                }
                speak()
    
    
    3. Immediate Invoke Function :-
        when a function is called as soon as it's object is created is known as Immediate Invoke Function.
    
        We have to write the function inside the paranthesis to group it.
    
            syntax :- 
                (function (){
                    // statement
                    // return keyword is not used here.
                })
            This whole thing hold the reference of Imm. Invoke Function
    
    
        The function is not visible(available) outside the scope.
    
        After grouping it, we have to use paranthesis to call this function.
    
            syntax :-
                (function (){
                    // statement
                    // return keyword is not used here.
                })();
    
        Immediate Invoke Function execute only once.
    
        This function doesnot return anything. Even JS Engine is also not returning anything.
    
    
    4. Arrow Function :- 
        The main function of arrow function is to reduce the function syntax.
    
        Arrow Function is introduced in ES6.
    
            syntax :-
            (Parameter) => {
                // statement
            }
    
            => :- called Flat Operator
    
        If we have only single parameter, it is not necessary to use paranthesis for paramenter.
            syntax :-
            a => {
                return "Hello";
            }
    
        If function have single statement, then block(paranthesis) is optional
            syntax :-
            (a,b) => a+b;
    
        Arrow functions are always anonymous.
    
        It does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. 
        
        Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and non-binding of this.
    
        In Arrow Function, we have two types of return :-
            1. Implicit return
            2. Explicit return
    
        4.1. Implicit return
            If there is only one statement and 
            If block is not created then JS Engine will return that statement automatically.
            
    
        4.2. Explicit return 
            If block is created and function is not returning any value, JS Engine will return undefined.
            To return a value Explicitly from block, we have to use return keyword.
            
            If block is created then we have to use return keyword to return value otherwise JS Engine will return undefined.
    
    Functional Programming :-
        Functional Programming is a programming technique where we pass a function along with a value to another function.
    
        In this approach, we generate "Generic Function". Here function task is not predefined. It perform multiple task not only single task.
    
        The Function which accept another function as a parameter or return a function is known as "Higher Order Function".
    
        The Function which is passed to another function or the function which is returned by another function is known as "Callback Function".
    
            syntax :-
                function variable_Name(task, parameter1, parameter2){
                    return task(parameter1,parameter2);
                }
    
                task is also a function called Callback Function.
    
    Nested Function :-
        The Function which is declared inside another function is called Nested Function.
    
        Outer function is Parent function and Inner function is child function.
    
    
        Inner function is local to the outer function, it means we cannot access inner function outside the outer function.
        To use(access) inner function outside the outer function -> it(outer function) should return the reference of inner function. With the help of inner function reference, we csn generate a call.
    
        Lexical scope :- 
            It is the ability of JS Engine to search for a variable on the outer scope when variable is not available in the local scope.
    
            When a function is nested, Lexical scope is available. So, we can access the member of Parent Function.
    
        Direction of Lexical Scope :-
            It will be Parent to child.
    
        Closure :-
            It is an object.
            It have state of parent. 
            Closure is achieved when there us one function inside another function.
            With the help of Closure, child can access the variable which is present inside te parent function.
    
            Closure help us to achieve Lexical scope or "Scope Chain".
    
            Closure preserve(store) the states of parent function even after the execution of parent function is completed.
    
            child function will have the reference of Closure.
    
            Every time, parent function is called -> new Closure is created.
    
            Closure is a function inside another function (parent function) anf has the access to the variable that are declared and defined inside the parent scope.
    
            Closure has access to variable in three scope:-
                When variable declared in their scope.
                When variable declared in a parent function scope.
                When variable declared in Global scope.
    
        Disadvantage of Closure :-
            High memory consumption.
    
    
    Array :-
        Array is a collection of heterogeneous element, arranged in an sequence, represented by integer value called index.
        
        Index start with zero(0) . Ending index is (array.length-1).
    
        Array size is not fixed i.e. Dynamic in nature means we can store 'N' number of element.
    
        Array is multi-value i.e. Non-primitive data type. 
    
        It is also the part of data structure (technique to store data in efficient ways).
    
    Way to create Array :-
        1. By using square bracket '[]' and literal.
    
            syntax :-
                let arr = []; // Empty Array
                let arr1 = [10,20,50,60,40];
    
        2. By using 'new' keyword and Array Constructor.
    
            syntax :-
                let arr = new Array(); // Empty Array
                    here, new -> keyword which create memory block
                          Array -> Array Constructor
    
                let arr1 = new Array(10,20,30,"Mohan");
                console.log(arr1); -> it will print the array.
    
    Question :- let arr = [10,20,30,40,50];
    How to Find length of array? 
    How to Access the array element?
    
    Property of Array :-
        1. length Property :- It will print the size of array.
            syntax :-
                Array_Reference.length
    
        2. Access array element :- 
            syntax :-
                Array_Reference[index]
    
            Note :- If we try to access the index that it greater than the array length -> We get undefined because size of array is not fixed in JS (i.e. Dynamic in nature). JS Engine managed the size, it doesnot take extra space in memory.
                Here we don't get Array out of bound exception as like in Java.
    
    In array we have loop :-
        1. for of loop
        2. for in loop
        3. for each loop
    
    for of loop :-
        It will access Array element.
        It start from zero(0) and end(stop iteration) at Array_Reference.length-1 .
    
        syntax :-
            for(variable_to_store_value of Array_Reference) {
                // Statement
            }
    
    for in  loop :-
        It will access Array index.
        It start from zero(0) and end(stop iteration) at Array_Reference.length-1 .
    
        syntax :-
            for(variable_to_store_index in Array_Reference) {
                // Statement
            }
    
    foreach loop :-
        It will not return anything.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.foreach((value, index, array) => {
                // Statement
            })
    
    
    Function â€” a set of instructions that perform a task.
    Method â€” a set of instructions that are associated with an object.
    
    1. push()
        It will insert element at last of the array
        It return array length.
        syntax :- 
            Array_Reference.push(value)
    
    2. pop()
        It will delete the array element from last index.
        It will return deleted element.
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.pop()
    
    3. unshift()
        It will insert element at 0th index'
        It will return array length.
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.unshift(value)
    
    4. shift()
        It will delete the array element from 0th index.
        It will return deleted element.
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.shift()
    
    5. splice()
        It will modify the original array.
        It will return array of deleted elements.
        We can perform Addition(insertion), Deletion & Replace of element.
        
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.splice(a,b,c)
            here, a -> starting index.
                  b -> number of element we want to delete.
                  c -> element we want to store.
    
            For Insertion :-
                Array_Reference.splice(a,0,c)
            For Deletion :-
                Array_Reference.splice(a,b)

            here, a -> starting index.
                  b -> Ending index.
    
    
    7. indexOf()
        If value is available, it will return the index else it will return -1.

    9. reverse()
        It will reverse the original array.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.reverse()
    
    10 . sort()
        It is high order function. 
        If function return positive value - sort in ascending manner.
        If function return negative value - sort in descending manner.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.sort(callback)
                callback function :  (a,b) => b-a
            eg :- Array_Reference.sort((a,b) => b-a)
    
    11. flat()
        It will reduce the dimension of array.
        
        syntax :- 
            Array_Reference.flat(depth)
            here, default value of depth is 1
    
        Array Flatening :- It is the process of reducing the dimensionality if array.
    
    12. isArray()
        It will return true if value is array else return false.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.isArray(value)
    
    13. from()
        It will convert value into array.
        It will return new array.
    
        syntax :- 
            Array_Reference.from(value)    
                here, value should be iterable like "name".
    
    // Ecmascript Method
        Ecmascript Method are high order function.
        1. map()    2. filter()     3. reduce()
            Non of the above three Method modify the original array.
    
    
    14. map()
        It is high order function.
        It is used to modify value and create new array of modify value.
        It will not modify original array.
        It will return new array,  new array will have value those are returned by callback function.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.map((value, index, array) => {
                //Statement
                // return value*2;
                return value/index/array; 
            })
    
    foreach loop :-
        It will not return anything.
    
        syntax :-
            Array_Reference.foreach((value, index, array) => {
                // Statement
                return value;
            })
    
    15. filter()
        It is high order function.
        It is used to create new array of value on some condition.
        It will not modify original array.
        It will return true or false, if filter return true then only value will inserted into new array.
    
        syntax :- 
            Array_Reference.filter((value, index, array) => {
                if(condition){
                    //Statement
                    return value/index/array;
                }
            })
    
    16. reduce()
